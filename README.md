Iâ€™m a passionate Python developer building scalable backends, data-driven applications, and automation tools. I love optimizing code, designing clean architectures, and sharing knowledge through open-source contributions.

ðŸ”­ Currently building: LLM-based chatbots & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems

ðŸŒ± Learning: Deep learning frameworks, vector databases, and container orchestration

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Flask, FastAPI, async Python, RAG pipelines, and prompt engineering

ðŸš€ Featured LLM Projects:

ChatFlux: Custom conversational agent with LangChain & OpenAI embeddings

DocRetriever: Document search API using Elasticsearch and Pinecone

ðŸ“« Reach me at: shamsiamirhossein1@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact: I built a RAG system that can source answers from my personal knowledge base and respond in under 200ms
